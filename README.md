<p> Overview: <p>
We are analyzing and visualizing data from the citibike in New York to show that a bike share program business is a viable idea in Des Moines Iowa.
We are showing the Angel Investors a bike trip analysis as part our proposal.
Our visualizations show investors:
<p>-The length of time that bikes were checked out for all riders and genders<p>
<p>-The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week<p>
<p>-The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week<p>
<p>
<p>Additionally, as Des Moines Iowa is different demographically than New York City, we created charts to show the age demographic that most often used the bike share program as well as the average distance that each rider rode.<p>
<p>It is important to take these measures into consideration to see if people will actually be able to use the bikes conveniently to get to their destination. If most people's travel from place to place is long, then they most likely won't be using a bike share.
Additionally, this presentation could benefit from involving public transit and or ride share data to show that there is a demographic of people that may prefer to use the bike share instead of taking a short bus, subway or Uber ride.<p>
<p>Lastly, the Charts described<p>
<p>Checkout Times for Users<p>
<p>-Riders frequently only have the bikes checked out for 5 minutes. This could mean that in New York the bikes are most often used by individuals that have to go somewhere that would typically be a long walk, but to make it quicker they use the bike. An example could be someone that gets off of the Subway and completes their commute to work using the bike.<p>
<p>Create the Checkout Times by Gender Viz<p>
<p>-This graph divides up the checkout times by Gender. We can infer that more men check the bikes out than any other gender and that women check the bikes out for slightly more time than men on average.<p>
<p>TRIPS BY WEEKDAY PER HOUR<p>
<p>This graph displays when the most trips were taken with the bikes for each hour of each day.<p>
<p>We can infer from this graph that during the weekdays, the bikes are most often used in the mornings and then in the evenings. The afternoon is typically lighter Monday to Thursday. Saturdays are the most popular days for the bikes as it appears that they are checked out more evenly throughout the day, possibly as an activity for people to do.<p>
<p>Trips by Gender<p>
<p>This graph displays that all Genders typically take trips around the same time as one another. We can see this from the similarity in shading on each of the charts.<p>
<p>User Trips by Gender by Weekday<p>
<p>Lastly, this chart shows us a breakdown of the usage of the bikes by Gender and whether they were a Customer or a Subscriber.<p>
<p>We can see that Males that are subscribers use the bikes the most during the week as opposed to the weekend. Oddly though, subscribers use the bikes the least on Wednesdays.<p>
<p>Average Trip Duration<p>
<p>I created this graph to simply display the most common amount of time that riders are using the bikes for. From the chart we can see that rider are mostly using the bikes between 4 and 6 minutes. With this we would be able to interview riders and get a better idea of what they are doing on these rides, this way we can have a better idea of where to station the bikes. IE: If riders typically take the bikes after getting off of the bus or subway then it would be best to station our bike pickup/returns near public transit.<p>
<p>Customer + Subscriber Breakdown<p>
<p>I created this chart to get an idea of what percentage of riders are Customers vs. Subscribers and divide this data by Gender. We can see that Males are more commonly subscribers than the other genders.<p>

<p>Summary<p>
<p>The bikes provide people with a quick and cheap form of exercise and transportation when they need to travel a short distance. The bikes can be easily incorporated with people's commutes to help reduce their time walking, or so that they don't have to take a short bus trip to finish their commute. Additionally the bikes are great for tourists and people looking to get some leisurely exercise on the weekend. 
It would be best to survey the city of Des Moines Iowa and see if these use cases will be able to fill a need of it's residents and to see if the cities landscape is appropriate for the bikes.<p>
